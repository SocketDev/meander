# CLAUDE.md

🚨 **MANDATORY**: Act as principal-level engineer with deep expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, static-site generation, and CLI design.

## USER CONTEXT

- Identify users by git credentials; use their actual name, never "the user"
- Use "you/your" when speaking directly; use names when referencing contributions

## 🚨 PARALLEL CLAUDE SESSIONS — WORKTREE REQUIRED

**This repo may have multiple Claude sessions running concurrently against the same checkout, against parallel git worktrees, or against sibling clones.** Several common git operations are hostile to that and silently destroy or hijack the other session's work.

- **FORBIDDEN in the primary checkout** (the one another Claude may be editing):
  - `git stash` — shared stash store; another session can `pop` yours.
  - `git add -A` / `git add .` — sweeps files belonging to other sessions.
  - `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch <branch>` — yanks the working tree out from under another session.
  - `git reset --hard` against a non-HEAD ref — discards another session's commits.
- **REQUIRED for branch work**: spawn a worktree instead of switching branches in place. Each worktree has its own HEAD, so branch operations inside it are safe.

  ```bash
  # From the primary checkout — does NOT touch the working tree here.
  git worktree add -b <task-branch> ../<repo>-<task> main
  cd ../<repo>-<task>
  # edit, commit, push from here; the primary checkout is untouched.
  cd -
  git worktree remove ../<repo>-<task>
  ```

- **REQUIRED for staging**: surgical `git add <specific-file> [<file>…]` with explicit paths. Never `-A` / `.`.
- **If you need a quick WIP save**: commit on a new branch from inside a worktree, not a stash.

The umbrella rule: never run a git command that mutates state belonging to a path other than the file you just edited.

## 📚 SHARED STANDARDS

- Commits: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — NO AI attribution
- **Open PRs:** when adding commits to an OPEN PR, ALWAYS update the PR title and description to match the new scope. A title like `chore: foo` after you've added security-fix and docs commits to it is now a lie. Use `gh pr edit <num> --title "..." --body "..."` (or `--body-file`) and rewrite the body so it reflects every commit on the branch, grouped by theme. The reviewer should be able to read the PR description and know what's in it without scrolling commits.
- 🚨 NEVER write a real customer or company name into any commit, PR, issue, GitHub comment, or release note. When about to write any name, stop and ask: "is this a real company?" If yes, replace it with `Acme Inc` (or drop the reference entirely). No enumerated denylist exists anywhere — a denylist is itself a leak. Recognition is done at write time, every time. The `.claude/hooks/public-surface-reminder` hook re-prints this rule on every public-surface `git`/`gh` command as a priming nudge; the rule still applies when the hook is not installed.
- NEVER reference issue-tracker IDs (e.g. `SOC-123`, `ENG-456`, `ASK-789`, Linear URLs, Sentry URLs) in code, code comments, or PR titles/descriptions/review comments. Tracking lives in the tracker; keep the codebase and PR history tool-agnostic.
- Scripts: `pnpm run foo --flag` (not `foo:bar`). Add tools as pinned devDependencies first.
- After `package.json` edits: `pnpm install`
- Backward Compatibility: 🚨 FORBIDDEN to maintain — actively remove when encountered
- 🚨 NEVER use `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, or `yarn dlx` — use `pnpm exec <package>` or `pnpm run <script>` # zizmor: documentation-prohibition
- **minimumReleaseAge**: the repo's `.npmrc` sets `min-release-age=7`. NEVER shorten or bypass without asking — the age threshold is a security control.

## Code Style

- Default to NO comments. Only when the WHY is non-obvious to a senior engineer.
- NEVER leave `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, shims, stubs, or placeholder code — finish 100%. If the task is too large for a single pass, inform the user and ask before cutting scope; don't silently reduce scope, and don't land half-work with a promise to fix it later.
- ❌ FORBIDDEN `any`; use `unknown` or specific types.
- Type imports: always `import type` (separate statements, never inline `type` in value imports).
- Prefer `undefined` over `null` except for `__proto__: null` or external API requirements.
- ALWAYS use `{ __proto__: null, ... }` for config/return/internal-state objects. Prevents prototype pollution and accidental inheritance.
- This repo has no HTTP dep of its own. If a feature needs one, propose the addition first (don't silently introduce `fetch()` or a new client).
- File existence: ALWAYS `existsSync` from `node:fs`. NEVER `fs.access`, `fs.stat`-for-existence, or an async `fileExists` wrapper.
- `fs` cherry-pick: `import { existsSync, promises as fs, readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "node:fs"`. `path`/`os`/`url`/`crypto` use default imports (`import path from "node:path"`). Exception: `fileURLToPath` is cherry-picked from `node:url`.
- ALWAYS use the Edit tool for code modifications, NEVER sed/awk.

### Sorting

Sort lists alphanumerically (literal byte order, ASCII before letters). Apply this to:

- **Config lists** — `permissions.allow` / `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`, `external-tools.json` checksum keys, the `keywords` array in `meander.config.json` parts, allowlists in workflow YAML.
- **Object key entries** — sort keys in plain JSON config + return-shape literals + internal-state objects. (Exception: `__proto__: null` always comes first, ahead of any data keys.)
- **Import specifiers** — sort named imports inside a single statement: `import { encrypt, randomDataKey, wrapKey } from './crypto.mts'`. Imports that say `import type` follow the same rule. Statement *order* is the project's existing convention (`node:` → external → local → types) — that's separate from specifier order *within* a statement.
- **Method / function source placement** — within a module, sort top-level functions alphabetically. Convention: private functions (lowercase / un-exported) sort first, exported functions second. The first-line `export` keyword is the divider.
- **Array literals** — when the array is a config list, allowlist, or set-like collection. Position-bearing arrays (e.g. argv, the `parts[]` walkthrough order, anything where index matters semantically) keep their meaningful order.

When in doubt, sort. The cost of a sorted list that didn't need to be is approximately zero; the cost of an unsorted list that did need to be is a merge conflict.

### `use strict`

- `.mts` / `.mjs` are ES modules — **always strict, never add `"use strict"`** (it's an error in strict ESM).
- `assets/**/*.js` (shipped client-side scripts) are **classic scripts** injected into HTML `<script>` tags without `type="module"` — they **MUST** begin with `"use strict";` at the top of the IIFE. Check existing assets (`sref.js`, `comment-client.js`, etc.) for the pattern.

### Promise.race in Loops

**NEVER re-race the same pool of promises across loop iterations.** Each call to `Promise.race([A, B, ...])` attaches fresh `.then` handlers to every arm; a promise that survives N iterations accumulates N handler sets. See [nodejs/node#17469](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/17469).

- **Safe**: `Promise.race([fresh1, fresh2])` where both arms are created per call (e.g. timeout wrappers).
- **Leaky**: `Promise.race(pool)` inside a loop where `pool` persists across iterations (the classic concurrency-limiter bug).
- **Fix**: single-waiter signal — each task's `.then` resolves a one-shot `promiseWithResolvers` that the loop awaits, then replaces. No persistent pool, nothing to stack.

## Token Hygiene — Non-Negotiable

🚨 **Never** emit the raw value of any secret to any tool output, commit message, comment, or assistant response. A `PreToolUse` hook at `.claude/hooks/token-hygiene/` enforces this programmatically — commands that would leak token values are refused before the tool runs.

**The hook blocks (exit code 2):**

1. Literal token shapes pasted into a command: Val Town (`vtwn_`), GitHub (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghs_`/`ghu_`/`ghr_`/`github_pat_`), GitLab (`glpat-`), AWS (`AKIA…`), Slack (`xoxb-`/`xoxa-`/…), Google (`AIza…`), OpenAI/Anthropic-shape `sk-…`, three-segment JWTs (`eyJ…`), and others.
2. `env` / `printenv` / `export -p` / `set` with no redaction pipeline.
3. `cat` / `head` / `tail` / `less` / `more` / `bat` of `.env*` files without a redactor.
4. `curl -H "Authorization: ..."` when the response body goes to unfiltered stdout. Allowed when redirected to a file / `/dev/null` or piped to `jq`/`grep`/`head`/`tail`/`wc`/`cut`/`awk`/`python3 -m json.tool`.
5. Commands referencing a sensitive env var name (`*TOKEN*`, `*SECRET*`, `*PASSWORD*`, `*API_KEY*`, `*SIGNING_KEY*`, `*PRIVATE_KEY*`, `*AUTH*`, `*CREDENTIAL*`) that write to stdout without a redaction step — unless it's a plain `git`/`pnpm`/`npm`/`node`/`tsc`/`oxfmt`/`oxlint` invocation that only surfaces names.

**If the hook blocks a command**, stderr explains why and suggests a fix. Rewrite the command; don't bypass the hook.

**Behavioral rules** (things the hook can't catch):

- When citing an API response, redact `token` / `jwt` / `access_token` / `refresh_token` / `api_key` / `secret` / `password` / `authorization` fields to `<redacted>` before including in your reply.
- When displaying `.env.local` (or similar), show **key names only** — never values.
- If a user pastes a secret into chat, treat the session copy as compromised and ask them to rotate. Never re-echo it.
- Prefer reading env values into subprocesses via `{ env: { ... } }` spawn options over `export FOO=bar && ...` chains, so the value never appears in the Bash tool's command string.

## 🏗️ MEANDER-SPECIFIC

### Architecture

Walkthrough generator + live comment system. Scans source files for multiline `/* ... */` comments, pairs each with the following code block, emits HTML pages per walkthrough part, and serves a Hono-based comment backend on Val Town.

- `src/cli.mts` — CLI dispatcher (`generate`, `serve`, `publish`, `deploy-val`)
- `src/generate.mts` — HTML emission, schema, PURL + annotation rendering
- `src/serve.mts` — local HTTP preview server (used by `pnpm dev`)
- `src/classifiers.mts` — inline `<code>` shape predicates (`isPurl`, `isEmail`, `isUrl`, `isScopedPackage`)
- `src/crypto.mts` — AES-256-GCM key derivation + encryption for at-rest content
- `src/publish.mts` — encrypt + upload generated HTML to Val Town blob storage
- `src/deploy-val.mts` — one-shot Val Town val deploy
- `assets/` — client-side JS (classic scripts, `"use strict"` at top of IIFE), logos, favicon, meander.css
- `assets/val/` — the Hono HTTP handler deployed to Val Town
- `scripts/` — development automation (lint, fix, check, update, clean, dev, test, cover)
- `test/` — vitest tests; `test/fixtures/test-docs/` is the reference fixture used by `pnpm dev` + CI smoke

### Commands

- **Dev preview**: `pnpm dev` — generates `test/fixtures/test-docs/pages/` and serves it at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
- **Build**: `pnpm build` (tsc; emits `.mjs` + `.d.mts` to `dist/`)
- **Test**: `pnpm test` (vitest against `test/**/*.test.mts`)
- **Coverage**: `pnpm cover` (vitest --coverage + type-coverage)
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint` (oxlint)
- **Fix**: `pnpm fix` (oxfmt + oxlint --fix — mutates in place)
- **Check-all**: `pnpm check` (lint + type-check; what CI runs)
- **Clean**: `pnpm clean` (safeDelete of `dist/`, `coverage/`, fixture emit dirs)
- **Update deps**: `pnpm update` (taze with 7-day maturity period + reinstall)

### Configuration files

| File                         | Purpose                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tsconfig.json`              | NodeNext + `.mts` source + rewrite imports to `.mjs`       |
| `.oxlintrc.json`             | Fleet-wide oxlint rules                                    |
| `.config/taze.config.mts`    | Dep-update policy (`maturityPeriod: 7`, `mode: 'latest'`)  |
| `.npmrc`                     | `ignore-scripts=true`, `min-release-age=7`                 |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml`        | `.claude/hooks/*` registered as workspace packages         |
| `.node-version`              | Pinned node version (25.9.0)                               |

### Node + TypeScript

- Source files are `.mts`. Node 25+ runs them natively — no flag needed (the pinned version lives in `.node-version`). The `scripts/` runners just shell out to `node scripts/foo.mts`.
- `tsconfig.json` enables `allowImportingTsExtensions` + `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` — imports say `.mts`, tsc rewrites to `.mjs` at build time so the same source runs under Node (native) OR under the dist'd output.
- `erasableSyntaxOnly` is enforced: no runtime-only TS syntax (no `enum`, no namespaces, etc.).
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is enforced: `arr[i]` has type `T | undefined`.

### File structure rules

- TypeScript sources in `src/` are `.mts` — never `.ts`. Never re-add `.ts` by mistake.
- NEVER add `"use strict"` to `.mts` / `.mjs` files (ES modules are always strict).
- DO add `"use strict";` at the top of the IIFE in `assets/**/*.js` (classic scripts shipped to the browser).
- Type imports: always `import type` (separate statements, never inline `type` in value imports).

### Consumer contract

Meander is published to npm as `@divmain/meander`. Consumers place `meander.config.json` at the root of their project and call `meander generate`. The config schema is defined via TypeBox in `src/config.mts` (`MeanderConfigSchema` + sub-schemas for parts, docs, favicon, comments, theme, styles). **Breaking config-schema changes need a major version bump** and a migration note in the release.

- `slug`, `title`, `parts[]` — required
- `documents[]` — optional tabbed Markdown reference docs
- `comments: false` — opt out of the inlined comment client
- `favicon` — object (per-size asset overrides, `themeColor` meta), or `false` to skip favicon emission entirely

### Assets pipeline

- Logos: authored as `assets/logo/logo-black.svg` (master silhouette). Color + bezel variants are regenerated from the master via the scripts in `scripts/` when the master changes.
- Favicon: generated from `assets/favicon/favicon.svg` (the brand mark) at 16/32/48/180 + `.ico` bundle. Not auto-rebuilt — regenerate manually when the mark changes.
- SVGs: source SVGs stay verbose — inline SVGs shipped in HTML are optimized at emit time via `src/minify.mts` when the consumer enables `config.minify.svg`. There's no source-tree rewrite pass.

### hljs CDN

- `src/generate.mts` emits `<script>` + `<link>` tags for the pinned @highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.11.1. Every tag carries an SRI `integrity="sha384-..."` computed from the pinned bytes. If the pin bumps, recompute:
  ```bash
  curl -sL <url> | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | base64
  ```
- TypeScript grammar is loaded alongside core hljs so `@example` fenced `typescript` blocks highlight correctly.

### Agents & Hooks

- `.claude/hooks/check-new-deps/` — blocks `pnpm add` / `npm install` of an unvetted package
- `.claude/hooks/token-hygiene/` — blocks commands that would leak secrets
- `.claude/hooks/public-surface-reminder/` — nudge-not-block reminder before `git commit`/`git push`/`gh pr` that customer names and tracker IDs must stay out of public surface

### Testing & CI

See [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) for the test
layout, coverage thresholds, tmpdir + `safeDelete` pattern,
and CI pinning rules.

### Context & edit safety

- After 10+ messages: re-read files before editing.
- Before/after every edit: re-read to confirm.
- Tool results over 50K chars are silently truncated — narrow scope and re-run if sparse.
- Tasks touching >5 files: use sub-agents with worktree isolation.

### Judgment & completion

- If the user's request is based on a misconception, say so before executing.
- If you spot a bug adjacent to what was asked, flag it: "I also noticed X — want me to fix it?"
- Fix warnings when you find them (lint, type-check, build, runtime) — don't leave them for later.
- **Default to perfectionist mindset**: pick the maximally correct option; no shortcuts. If pragmatism is the right call, the user will ask.
- Before calling done: present two views — perfectionist reject vs. pragmatist ship — and let the user decide. If the user gives no signal, default to perfectionist.
- If a fix fails twice: stop, re-read top-down, state where the mental model was wrong, try something fundamentally different.
- NEVER claim done at 80% — finish 100% before reporting. Fix forward, don't revert; reverting requires explicit user approval. After EVERY code change: build, test, verify, commit — one atomic unit.
